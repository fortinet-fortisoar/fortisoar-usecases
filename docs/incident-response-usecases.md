# Incident Response Usecases

- We have integrated FAZ and SIEM with SOAR for our day-to-day Alert/Incident investigation process.
- All alerts/Events ingested to FSR are enriched for IOC using VirusTotal and CTS Fortiguard.
- All alerts/Incidents have defined SLA's and are reviewed every week.
- For certain alerts we have defined additional automation by integrating FSR to FGT's to auto-quarantine malicious IP's on the FGT which are doing brute force type attacks.
- We also ingest abuse emails as alerts in FSR to track and work on them.
- Our Incident response module covers alerts from multiple Fortinet Products like - Fortigates, Forticlient, Fortideceptor, FortiEDR.
- MIS Incident response covers Alerts/Incidents for multiple internal Teams like - FortiStack, Fortiguard, Forticloud and MIS.
